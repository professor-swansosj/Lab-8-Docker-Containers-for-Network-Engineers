# Lab Instructions

## Lab Title
`<Insert Lab Name Here>`

## Version
`<v1.0 / Date>`

## Estimated Time
`<e.g., 45‚Äì60 minutes>`

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- `<Objective 1 ‚Äì e.g., Use Git to clone and manage a repository>`
- `<Objective 2 ‚Äì e.g., Write Python code that logs network automation tasks>`
- `<Objective 3 ‚Äì e.g., Execute commands on a Cisco device using Netmiko>`

These objectives build foundational skills for aspiring **network engineers** and **infrastructure specialists**.

---

## Tools & Technologies
You will use:
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code (with Dev Containers)
- Linux CLI
- Python 3.x
- Ansible
- Docker
- cURL / Postman
- Cisco Catalyst Lab Device (DevNet Sandbox or assigned)
- `<Add any lab-specific tools>`

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you:
- Understand basic Linux navigation and file manipulation
- Know how to clone, commit, and push using Git
- Can write and run simple Python scripts
- Have access to the GitHub Classroom repository and Dev Container

---

## Deliverables
To receive credit, you must:
- Push your code changes to GitHub
- Generate a **log file** (`lab.log`) with the exact required log entries
- Ensure the autograder can find these log messages  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** No log file = no points, even if your code ‚Äúworked.‚Äù The grader only checks for log entries.

---

## Overview
In this lab you will:  
- `<High-level description of lab>`
- Apply automation tools to solve a **real networking task**
- Learn how automation skills directly apply to professional engineering workflows  

üí° **Why this matters:** Modern networks cannot be managed manually at scale. Automation skills give you an edge as a job candidate and make you more effective in real-world environments.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 ‚Äì Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

### Step 2 ‚Äì Open a Dev Container
1. Launch VS Code
2. Select "Reopen in Container"
3. Wait for dependencies to install
NOTE: This can take a few minutes on first load

LOG REQUIREMENT: `[STEP 2] Dev Container Started`


### Step 3 ‚Äì Complete the Python Script



### Step 4 ‚Äì Run Network Command


### Step 5 ‚Äì Commit & Push Your Work


### Step 6 ‚Äì Open a Pull Request


## Troubleshooting
